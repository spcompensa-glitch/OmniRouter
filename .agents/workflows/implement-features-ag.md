# /implement-features — Feature Request Harvest, Research & Implementation Workflow

## Overview

A **5-phase** workflow that systematically harvests feature requests from GitHub issues, creates structured idea files, researches solutions across the internet and Git repositories, presents a consolidated report for user approval, then generates detailed implementation plans and executes them.

**Output directory structure:**

```
_ideia/
├── viable/                  # Features approved for implementation
│   ├── need_details/        # ❓ Good idea but waiting for author clarification (issues stay OPEN)
│   │   └── 1015-warp-terminal-mitm.md
│   ├── 1046-native-playground.md           # ✅ Ready — researched and planned
│   └── 1046-native-playground.requirements.md
├── defer/                   # ⏭️ Good ideas deferred for future cycles (issues CLOSED)
│   └── 1041-smart-auto-combos.md
└── notfit/                  # ❌ Out of scope / already exists (issues CLOSED)
    └── 945-telegram-integration.md

_tasks/features-vX.Y.Z/   # Implementation plans (per-release)
└── 1046-native-playground.plan.md
```

> **LIFECYCLE RULE:** `viable/` files are **DELETED** once the feature is implemented — they are not moved. Only unimplemented features live in `viable/` (or `viable/need_details/`). Files in `defer/` and `notfit/` remain as permanent reference.

> **BRANCH RULE**: All implementation work MUST happen on the current `release/vX.Y.Z` branch. Never create separate `feat/` branches. If no release branch exists yet, create one first using `/generate-release` Phase 1 steps 1–5.

---

## Phase 0 — Pre-flight Triage (NEW)

Before harvesting, run a deterministic triage script that decides which issues to absorb, which to leave dormant, which were already delivered, and which need lifecycle cleanup. This phase replaces the old Phase 1.1/1.2 and gates the rest of the workflow on the triage JSON.

### 0.1 Identify the Repository

// turbo

- Run: `git -C <project_root> remote get-url origin` to extract owner/repo.

### 0.2 Ensure Release Branch Exists

// turbo

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# If on main, determine next version and create the release branch
VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
NEXT=$(node -p "const [a,b,c]=('$VERSION').split('.').map(Number); c>=9?a+'.'+(b+1)+'.0':a+'.'+b+'.'+(c+1)")
git checkout -b release/v$NEXT
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version
npm install
```

If already on a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch, continue working there.

### 0.3 Run feature-triage script

// turbo

```bash
node scripts/features/feature-triage.mjs \
  --owner <OWNER> --repo <REPO> \
  --output _ideia/_triage.json \
  --verbose
```

Read `_ideia/_triage.json` into context. Buckets present: `absorb`, `dormant`, `already_delivered`, `skip_assigned`, `skip_has_pr`, `stale_need_details`, `stale_defer`, `closed_externally`.

> **Defaults** (overridable via flags or env vars):
> quarantine=14d, override-thumbs=5, override-commenters=3, stale-needs=30d, stale-defer=90d.

### 0.4 Apply deterministic actions (in this exact order)

For each bucket, perform the action described. **Order matters** — `already_delivered` runs first because its close action precludes any other processing.

1. **`already_delivered`** — pick comment template based on `version_source` + `confidence`:
   - `version_source == "tag_after_merge"` AND `confidence == "high"` → template **HIGH** (see Phase 2.5.3)
   - `version_source == "tag_after_merge"` AND `confidence == "medium"` → template **MEDIUM** (asks for verification)
   - `version_source == "branch_unreleased"` → template **unreleased**
   - Then `gh issue close <N> --repo <O>/<R> --comment "<rendered template>"`

2. **`closed_externally`** — for each entry, `rm` the file (log to stderr what was removed).

3. **`stale_need_details`** — for each entry, post the stale template (see Phase 2.5.3), close the issue, then `mv <file> _ideia/notfit/stale/`.

4. **`skip_assigned` / `skip_has_pr`** — no action (silent skip).

5. **`dormant`** — no action (total silence; the JSON records the decision for internal visibility only).

6. **`warnings`** — log each warning to stderr; include them in the Phase 3 report.

> **Note**: issues with `confidence == "low"` are not in `already_delivered` — they appear in `absorb`/`dormant` with a warning, so step 0.4.1 never sees them.

### 0.5 Incremental re-sync for existing idea files in `absorb`

For each `absorb` entry where `existing_idea_file != null`, the script already updated the file via `resync.mjs`. No additional action needed in this step — but verify with `git status` that only expected idea files were modified.

If the entry has `needs_reclassification: true`, move the file out of `_ideia/viable/need_details/` back to `_ideia/` root for Phase 2 to re-classify.

---

## Phase 1 — Harvest: Collect & Catalog Feature Ideas

> Phases 1.1 and 1.2 are now handled by Phase 0.1 and 0.2.

### 1.3 Process triage results

Instead of re-fetching every open issue, use the `_ideia/_triage.json` produced by Phase 0.3. Iterate only over:

- `buckets.absorb[]` — issues that passed quarantine (age ≥ 14d OR engagement override)
- `buckets.stale_defer[]` — deferred ideas due for re-evaluation

For each `absorb` entry, the JSON already includes `number`, `title`, `author`, `created_at`, `age_days`, `thumbs`, `commenters`, `labels`, `existing_idea_file`, and `last_synced_comment_id`. Fetch the full issue body only if needed for Phase 2 research.

For each `stale_defer` entry, **treat it as a fresh idea**:

- Re-run Phase 2 (Research) from scratch — codebase may have evolved in 90+ days, opening new architectural possibilities
- Re-run Phase 2.5 (Organize & Respond) and let the new verdict decide:
  - If still **DEFER** → stay in `_ideia/defer/`, but bump `snapshot.classified_at` so the next check is 90 days from now
  - If **VIABLE** → move to `_ideia/viable/`, post the "we're picking this back up" variant of the VIABLE comment
  - If **NOT FIT** → move to `_ideia/notfit/`, close issue with NOT FIT template

You may batch `gh issue view` calls in parallel (up to 4 at a time) when fresh fetches are required.

> Old behavior (fetching every open issue with `gh issue list`) is replaced by Phase 0.3.

### 1.4 Create Idea Files (initially in `_ideia/` root)

> **If `existing_idea_file != null` in the triage JSON**, the file was already re-synced in Phase 0.5 — skip the create/update step and proceed to Phase 2 for that issue.
>
> **If `needs_reclassification == true`**, the file was moved back to `_ideia/` root in Phase 0.5 — treat it as a fresh idea for the rest of the run.

For each feature request, create a structured idea file in `<project_root>/_ideia/`:

**Filename convention**: `<NUMBER>-<kebab-case-short-title>.md`
Example: `1046-native-playground.md`, `1041-smart-auto-combos.md`

#### 1.4a — If the idea file does NOT exist yet, create it:

```markdown
---
issue: <NUMBER>
last_synced_at: <ISO_TIMESTAMP_NOW>
last_synced_comment_id: <MAX_COMMENT_ID_OR_0>
snapshot:
  thumbs: <THUMBS_COUNT>
  commenters: <COMMENTERS_COUNT>
  age_days: <AGE_DAYS>
  labels: [<LABEL_LIST>]
  state: open
  classified_at: <ISO_TIMESTAMP_NOW>

---

## Phase 2 — Research: Find Solutions & Build Requirements

For each cataloged idea that is **viable** (aligns with the project's goals):

### 2.1 Viability Pre-Check

Before investing in research, quickly assess:

- [ ] Does this feature align with the project's goals and architecture?
- [ ] Is it technically feasible with the current codebase?
- [ ] Does it duplicate existing functionality?
- [ ] Would it introduce breaking changes or security risks?
- [ ] Is there enough detail to understand what's needed?

**Verdict options:**

| Verdict               | When                                  | Action                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ✅ **VIABLE**         | Good idea, enough context             | Proceed to Research         |
| ❓ **NEEDS DETAIL**   | Good idea, insufficient spec          | Skip research, ask author   |
| ⏭️ **DEFER**          | Good idea, too complex for this cycle | Catalog only, skip research |
| ❌ **NOT FIT**        | Doesn't fit the project               | Explain why                 |
| 🔁 **ALREADY EXISTS** | Feature already implemented           | Point to existing feature   |

### 2.2 Internet Research (for VIABLE features)

For each viable feature, perform systematic research:

**Step 1 — Web search for similar implementations:**

```
WebSearch("how to implement <feature description> in <tech stack>")
WebSearch("<feature keyword> implementation nextjs typescript 2025 2026")
WebSearch("<feature keyword> open source library npm")
```

**Step 2 — Find reference Git repositories:**

```
WebSearch("site:github.com <feature keyword> <tech stack> stars:>100")
WebSearch("github <feature keyword> implementation recently updated 2026")
```

- Find **up to 10 relevant repositories**, sorted by most recently updated.
- For each repository:
  - Note the repo URL, star count, last commit date
  - Read its README and relevant source files via `WebFetch`
  - Extract the architectural approach, patterns used, and key code snippets

**Step 3 — Read API docs and standards:**

If the feature involves an external API, protocol, or standard:

- Find and read the official documentation
- Note version requirements, authentication patterns, rate limits

### 2.3 Create Requirements File

For each researched feature, create a requirements file alongside its idea file:

**Filename**: `<NUMBER>-<kebab-case-short-title>.requirements.md`

```markdown
# Requirements: <Feature Title>

> Feature Idea: [#<NUMBER>](./<NUMBER>-<kebab-case-short-title>.md)
> Research Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
> Verdict: ✅ VIABLE

## 🔍 Research Summary

---

## Phase 2.5 — Organize & Respond: Sort Files and Post GitHub Comments

### 2.5.1 Create Directory Structure

// turbo

```bash
mkdir -p <project_root>/_ideia/viable
mkdir -p <project_root>/_ideia/viable/need_details
mkdir -p <project_root>/_ideia/defer
mkdir -p <project_root>/_ideia/notfit
```

### 2.5.2 Move Idea Files to Category Subdirectories

After classification, move EVERY idea file to its correct subdirectory:

```bash
# ✅ VIABLE — move idea + requirements files
mv _ideia/<NUMBER>-*.md _ideia/viable/
mv _ideia/<NUMBER>-*.requirements.md _ideia/viable/

# ❓ NEEDS DETAIL — viable but waiting for author response
mv _ideia/<NUMBER>-*.md _ideia/viable/need_details/

# ⏭️ DEFER — move idea files only
mv _ideia/<NUMBER>-*.md _ideia/defer/

# ❌ NOT FIT & 🔁 ALREADY EXISTS — move idea files only
mv _ideia/<NUMBER>-*.md _ideia/notfit/
```

No files should remain in `_ideia/` root after this step (except subdirectories).

### 2.5.3 Post GitHub Comments by Category

**Each category has a specific comment template and action:**

---

#### For 🔁 ALREADY EXISTS — Comment + CLOSE issue

// turbo

The feature already exists in the system. Explain WHERE it is and HOW to use it.

```markdown
Hi @<author>! Thanks for the suggestion! 🙏

Great news — this functionality **already exists** in OmniRoute:

**📍 Where to find it:** <exact dashboard path or settings location>

**🔧 How to use it:**

1. <step 1>
2. <step 2>
3. <step 3>

If you have any trouble finding or using it, feel free to ask in a Discussion. We're always happy to help!

Closing this as the feature is already available. 🎉
```

```bash
gh issue close <NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comment "<comment above>"
```

---

#### For ⏭️ DEFER — Comment + CLOSE issue

// turbo

Thank the user, explain the idea was cataloged, and that we'll study it before implementing.

```markdown
Hi @<author>! Thanks for this thoughtful feature request! 🙏

We really appreciate the detailed proposal. We've **cataloged your idea** and it's now part of our improvement backlog.

Due to the **significant architectural impact** of this feature, we'll need to conduct thorough use-case studies and architectural analysis before we start development. This ensures we build it right and don't introduce regressions.

**What happens next:**

- Your idea is saved in our internal feature backlog
- We'll conduct architecture studies when this area is prioritized
- We'll notify you here when development begins

Thank you for contributing to OmniRoute's roadmap! Your input helps shape the product. 🚀
```

```bash
gh issue close <NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comment "<comment above>"
```

---

#### For ❌ NOT FIT — Comment + CLOSE issue

// turbo

Politely explain why the feature doesn't fit the project scope.

```markdown
Hi @<author>! Thanks for the suggestion! 🙏

After careful analysis, we've determined that this feature **falls outside OmniRoute's core scope** as a proxy/router.

**Reason:** <explain why — e.g., "Telegram integration belongs in the application/orchestrator layer that consumes OmniRoute's API, not inside the router itself.">

**Alternative:** <suggest an alternative approach if possible>

We appreciate you thinking of ways to improve OmniRoute! If you'd like to discuss this further, feel free to open a Discussion. 🙏
```

```bash
gh issue close <NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comment "<comment above>"
```

---

#### For ❓ NEEDS DETAIL — Comment (keep OPEN)

// turbo

Ask for the specific missing details needed.

```markdown
Hi @<author>! Thanks for the feature request — it's an interesting idea and we'd love to explore it further. 🙏

To move forward, we need a few more details:

1. <specific question 1>
2. <specific question 2>
3. <specific question 3>

If you know of any **open-source projects or repositories** that implement something similar, please share links — it would help us design the best solution.

Looking forward to your response! 🚀
```

---

#### For ✅ VIABLE — Comment (keep OPEN)

// turbo

Thank the user, confirm we've cataloged their idea, and explain it may be implemented in future versions.

```markdown
Hi @<author>! Thanks for the great feature suggestion! 🙏

We've analyzed your request and it aligns well with OmniRoute's roadmap. We've **cataloged this feature** and it's in our implementation backlog.

**Status:** 📋 Cataloged for future implementation

This feature may be included in upcoming releases. We'll **respond to this issue and tag you** as soon as implementation begins so you can test it.

Thank you for helping improve OmniRoute! 🚀
```

**⚠️ Do NOT close viable issues — they remain OPEN for tracking.**

---

#### For 🎉 ALREADY DELIVERED — HIGH confidence

// turbo

Used when triage `confidence == "high"` and `version_source == "tag_after_merge"`. Close the issue with a celebratory comment pointing at the shipped version + PR.

```markdown
Hi @<author>! 🎉

Great news — this functionality was already delivered in version **<VERSION>** through PR #<PR_NUMBER> (<PR_TITLE>).

**How to try it:**
\`\`\`bash
git pull origin main && npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

If your use case is slightly different from what was shipped, feel free to reopen this issue or open a new one with the specific gap. Thanks for helping shape OmniRoute! 🚀
```

```bash
gh issue close <NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comment "<comment above>"
```

---

#### For 🎉 ALREADY DELIVERED — MEDIUM confidence

// turbo

Used when triage `confidence == "medium"`. More cautious — asks the author to verify.

```markdown
Hi @<author>! 🎉

This functionality appears to have been delivered in version **<VERSION>** based on related changes (PR #<PR_NUMBER>, CHANGELOG, commit history).

Could you please verify if the current release covers your request? If yes, feel free to close. If not, comment back with the gap and we'll reopen for further work.

**How to verify:**
\`\`\`bash
git pull origin main && npm install
\`\`\`

Thanks for contributing! 🚀
```

```bash
gh issue close <NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comment "<comment above>"
```

---

#### For 🎉 ALREADY DELIVERED — branch_unreleased

// turbo

Used when `version_source == "branch_unreleased"` (regardless of confidence). The fix is on a release branch that hasn't been tagged yet.

```markdown
Hi @<author>! 🎉

This functionality has been implemented in the upcoming release (branch `release/<VERSION>`, PR #<PR_NUMBER>) and will ship in the next release.

You can already try it on the release branch:
\`\`\`bash
git fetch origin && git checkout release/<VERSION>
npm install && npm run dev
\`\`\`

Closing now since the work is done — feel free to reopen if you spot any gaps after testing. 🚀
```

```bash
gh issue close <NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comment "<comment above>"
```

---

#### For ⏰ STALE NEED_DETAILS — Close after 30d without author reply

// turbo

Used for entries in `buckets.stale_need_details`. Polite close + invite to reopen + `mv` file to `notfit/stale/`.

```markdown
Hi @<author>! 🙏

Since we haven't heard back from you in about 30 days regarding the details we asked for, we're closing this issue to keep the backlog clean.

**No worries** — please feel free to **reopen** this issue whenever you have the details handy. Just click "Reopen" and reply with the missing information, and we'll pick it back up.

Thanks for thinking of OmniRoute! 🚀
```

```bash
gh issue close <NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comment "<comment above>"
mkdir -p _ideia/notfit/stale
mv <FILE_PATH> _ideia/notfit/stale/
```

### 4.3 Present Plans for Final Approval

Present a summary of all generated plans:

> **Implementation plans generated:**
>
> | #   | Feature | Plan File                                | Steps   | Effort |
> | --- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
> | 1   | <title> | `_tasks/features-vX.Y.Z/N-title.plan.md` | N steps | Medium |
>
> Reply **"sim"** or **"yes"** to begin implementation of all features.
> Reply with specific issue numbers to implement only certain ones.

---

## Phase 5 — Execute: Implement the Plans (after user says "yes")

> **⚠️ Do NOT enter this phase without explicit user approval from Phase 4.**

### 5.1 Implement Each Feature

For each approved plan, execute it step by step:

1. **Follow the plan** — implement exactly as specified in the `.plan.md` file
2. **Build** — Run `npm run build` after each feature to verify compilation
3. **Test** — Run `npm test` to ensure no regressions
4. **Commit** — Commit with: `feat: <description> (#<NUMBER>)`
5. **Update the plan** — Mark completed steps with `[x]` in the plan file
6. **Continue** — Move to the next feature (do NOT switch branches)

### 5.2 Respond to Authors (Update Viable Issues)

For each implemented feature, **close the issue with a final comment**:

````markdown
✅ **Implemented in `release/vX.Y.Z`!**

Hi @<author>! Great news — your feature request has been implemented! 🎉

**What was done:**

- <bullet list of what was built>

**How to try it:**

```bash
git fetch origin && git checkout release/vX.Y.Z
npm install && npm run dev
```
````

This will be included in the upcoming **vX.Y.Z** release. Feel free to reopen if you spot any issues! 🚀

````

```bash
gh issue close <NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comment "<comment above>"
````

Then **DELETE the idea file** — it has served its purpose:

```bash
# ✅ Implemented files are DELETED (not moved)
rm _ideia/viable/<NUMBER>-<title>.md
rm _ideia/viable/<NUMBER>-<title>.requirements.md  # if exists
```

> **Why delete?** `viable/` only holds features that still NEED to be done. Once implemented, the commit history and CHANGELOG are the source of truth. Keeping the file would be confusing.

### 5.3 Finalize & Push

After implementing all approved features:

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md** on the release branch with all new feature entries
2. Push the release branch: `git push origin release/vX.Y.Z`
3. Run `/generate-release` workflow Phase 1 steps 7–10 (tests → commit → push → open PR to main → wait for user)

### 5.4 Final Summary Report

Present a final summary report to the user:

| Issue | Title | Verdict         | Action                                             | Commit    |
| ----- | ----- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| #N    | Title | ✅ Implemented  | Issue closed, idea file deleted                    | `abc1234` |
| #N    | Title | ⏭️ Deferred     | Issue closed + saved in `_ideia/defer/`            | —         |
| #N    | Title | ❌ Not Fit      | Issue closed + saved in `_ideia/notfit/`           | —         |
| #N    | Title | 🔁 Exists       | Issue closed + saved in `_ideia/notfit/`           | —         |
| #N    | Title | ❓ Needs Detail | Issue OPEN, moved to `_ideia/viable/need_details/` | —         |

Include all counters from `_ideia/_triage.json` `counts` field plus:

- Total features harvested (= `counts.total_fetched`)
- Total absorbed and processed (= `counts.absorb`)
- Total dormant (skipped quarantine) (= `counts.dormant`)
- Total already-delivered (closed with version reference) (= `counts.already_delivered`)
- Total skipped (assigned + has PR) (= `counts.skip_assigned + counts.skip_has_pr`)
- Total stale need_details (closed after 30d silence) (= `counts.stale_need_details`)
- Total stale defer (re-classified) (= `counts.stale_defer`)
- Total cleaned up (closed externally) (= `counts.closed_externally`)
- Total ideas cataloged (`viable/need_details/` + `defer/` + `notfit/`)
- Total features implemented (idea files deleted, issues closed)
- Total issues closed
- Total issues left open
- Test results (pass/fail count)
- All `warnings[]` entries from `_triage.json`
